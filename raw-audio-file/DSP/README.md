Audio Delay Digital Signal Processing for GNU Linux Systems.

This code works with headerless (.raw) audio files.
It takes the signal from an input file, process the signal and writes it to an output file.
The audio signal should be in stereo 44100 Hz 16bit format. The code might not work properly using different parameters/resolutions.
